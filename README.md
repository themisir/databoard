# databoard

Work in progress tool to create API endpoints that executes queries on connected database.

> **âš  The project is on early-development stage.**

# Planned features

- [x] API interface for database
- [ ] Web GUI for viewing data or executing actions
- [ ] Authentication for both API and Web GUI access
- [ ] [Your suggesting might be implemented as well](https://github.com/themisir/databoard/issues/new)

# Why?

I hate building dashboards and especially the ones with tables to view data and do a few actions.
